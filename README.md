**Your private, on-device AI agent.**

OpenMinis brings leading models — Claude, GPT, Gemini and more — into a native
mobile experience, and gives them a real computer to work with: a full Linux
shell running on your device, browser automation, extensible skills, persistent
memory, and deep system integration.

It is free, and fully open source.

**We believe that in the age of AI, technical design and code are no longer
where a product's advantage lies. The best agent emerges from a tight feedback
loop with the people who use it — their expectations and their reports are
what converge on the product.**

## What it does

| | |
|---|---|
| **Bring your own model** | Claude, GPT, Gemini and other providers, via your own API keys or account sign-in. |
| **A real Linux shell** | A sandboxed Alpine Linux environment runs on-device — the agent can install packages, run scripts, and work with real files. |
| **Device integration** | Health, Calendar, Reminders, Contacts, HomeKit, Bluetooth, Clipboard, Media, Alarms and more, exposed to the agent as tools. |
| **Browser automation** | The agent can browse and interact with the web on your behalf. |
| **Skills & memory** | Extensible skills plus persistent memory across sessions. |
| **Workspaces** | Organise work into separate contexts, addressable via `minis://workspace/`. |
| **Native offloads** | Heavy or platform-specific work is handed to native code instead of the sandbox. |

## What you can do with Minis

A few things people actually use it for:

- **Photograph a meal, log the nutrition** — Minis identifies the dishes, estimates
  calories and macros, and writes them to Apple Health.
- **Wake up to your timeline** — Shortcuts triggers Minis to fetch your X timeline,
  summarise it, synthesise speech, and play it as your alarm.
- **Turn group chatter into tasks** — pull messages from a Telegram group, extract
  bugs and action items, deduplicate them, and file them into Apple Reminders.
- **Mount your Obsidian vault** — research, clean up and write Markdown notes back
  into the vault as a normal workspace.
- **Share anything into a calendar event** — send a page or message to Minis via the
  iOS Share Sheet and it creates the event, time and place included.

community-contributed collection of use cases and workflows across health,
productivity, research, finance and developer tooling.

## Skills

A **skill** is a folder with a `SKILL.md` file — instructions, and optionally scripts,
references and assets — that the agent loads on demand when a request matches it.
Metadata stays in context for triggering; the body and bundled resources load only
when the skill is actually used.

Minis has its own tool system, but it does not require skills written specifically
for it: **skills built for Claude, Codex, OpenClaw or Hermes Agent generally run in
Minis as-is.** Skills that have been adapted to Minis' tools simply run better —
they can reach the Linux shell, device integrations and native offloads directly.

**→ [OpenMinis/MinisSkills](https://github.com/OpenMinis/MinisSkills)** — skills
adapted for Minis alongside ones built for it from scratch, covering TTS, search,
media downloads, health analysis, cloud APIs and more.

## Beta programme

App Store releases can lag behind: every update waits on review, and we hold
builds back when stability warrants it. The TestFlight build is where fixes
and new features land first.

**→ [Join the TestFlight beta](https://testflight.apple.com/join/3BdkA5c3)**

On Android, the [releases page](https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis/releases)
always carries the latest APK.

## Building from source

Minis ships a Linux sandbox inside the app, so the native dependencies (iSH on
iOS, PRoot on Android, FFmpeg, LAME) and the Alpine rootfs are **built from
source** rather than committed as binaries.

**→ See [BUILDING.md](BUILDING.md) for the full first-build guide.**

The short version:

```sh
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/OpenMinis/OpenMinis.git
cd OpenMinis

# iOS  — order matters: FFmpeg links against LAME
./deps/build_lame.sh && ./deps/build_ffmpeg.sh
./deps/build_ish.sh && ./deps/prepare_alpine_rootfs.sh
open src/ios/Minis.xcodeproj

# Android — needs NDK r28+
./deps/build_proot.sh && ./scripts/prepare_android_sandbox.sh
cd src/android && ./gradlew :app:assembleDebug
```

`BUILDING.md` covers the toolchain requirements per platform, the build-time
customization templates, and a troubleshooting section for the failure modes
you are most likely to hit.

maintainers of these projects — the full inventory, with versions and license
terms, is in [THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md](THIRD_PARTY_LICENSES.md).

The app links GPL-licensed components — [iSH](https://github.com/OpenMinis/ish-arm64)
(GPLv3) and [PRoot](https://github.com/OpenMinis/proot) (GPLv2) — so the combined

This repository is a mirror of a private development tree, so it **does not
accept pull requests** — there is nowhere for them to land. Issues are the way

and [MinisSkills](https://github.com/OpenMinis/MinisSkills) both do take
contributions. See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md).
